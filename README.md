# whetstone
A heterogeneous project dependencies manager for Content Creators working on video game projects.
Whetstone can download binaries and sync them with the relevant Perforce changelist, for instance.
Think "Unreal Game Sync" but with different design decisions. One of them being to make the tool driven by generic
software components, so it could be adapted to any company/project's infrastructure and workflows.
