# whetstone
A project-manager for Content Creators working on video game projects. Whetstone can download binaries and sync them with the relevant Perforce version. Think "Unreal Game Sync" but with different design decisions. It might become Unreal Engine specific if need be but an attempt will be made at making it a generic tool.
